                  <p>  Parallax effect involves a web page’s background moving at a slower rate than the foreground. This creates an illusion of depth to the page, giving the content a 3D effect as viewers scroll down.Most page builders also incorporate a parallax effect tool, enabling you to add the effect to any page or post on your website.</p>

          <h2>What Are the Benefits of Using a Parallax Effect?</h2>
          <p>There are a number of benefits to using a parallax effect on your WordPress website. The first, and most obvious, is the visual aspect of a parallax effect. A parallax effect is aesthetically pleasing, giving your website a fresh, stylish and modern look and feel.Another key reason for using parallax effect on your site is to help break up a page, particularly a homepage, into readable chunks.Parallax effect can be used on any page or post of a website, but can be particularly seen on homepages, landing pages, or one-page sites.</p>

                   <div class="two-col">
                    <p>While parallax is great for adding visual interest, it does not always work well on mobile devices. Because phones and tablets typically use swipe navigation (instead of a scroll like desktops) parallax effects may not render correctly. Of course, this will depend on the method and animations you use for your own parallax section, however for good usability you may want to consider disabling parallax on devices.</p>
